If you want to run tests, define
  EXISTDB_REST_SERVER
  EXISTDB_REST_USER
  EXISTDB_REST_PASSWORD
in your environment with the server where you have eXist running (without any
protocol prefix), a user and her's password, with rights to access the
'/db/tests' collection. (for now, make sure the collection exists).
